# Noveltist Community Code of Conduct

This group follows the *Noveltist Community Model* and encourages participating projects using community technology to adhere to the principles outlined below in order to protect the primacy of research tasks and the availability of their results for all members of the community.

In this community, it is invited to share materials on the MMI topic, present your projects, join efforts with the authors of other projects, jointly solve the urgent tasks of this area and, most importantly, share technologies so that the maximum number of people have the opportunity to develop them.

* We believe that technologies and ideas are valuable in themselves and can evolve, and therefore the wider their distribution and the less we try to control it, the faster they will develop.
* For the same reason, we do not recognize methodological labels, such as dividing projects into scientific and art projects, since the construction of an effective cultural medium contributes to the development of technology no less than the competent construction of an experimental methodology.
* Any form of contribution to the development of MMI technologies is welcome.
* Counterproductive actions such as incitement to any form of hatred and devaluation of other people's achievements, as well as actions contrary to the goals of the community are prohibited.
* Commercial use of community technologies is possible by mutual agreement and provided that part of the profits will be used in the interests of the community.
* Exploration before profits - Non-profit models are preferable, since knowledge is the main value. 
* Commercialization of a project is acceptable as a way to obtain the necessary resources but the project should not be fully profit-oriented.
* Research oriented tasks should have higher priority than profit oriented ones.
* Denying research initiatives in favor of saving profits is unacceptable.
* Cooperation of noveltist projects with profit-oriented companies can be carried out on mutually beneficial terms that do not contradict the principles of the noveltist community.
* Technology should not be monopolized or controlled - Open Source model is preferable.
* Attempts to hide technology under NDA's or to restrict its usage will slow down the progress. Any project that can participate in technology development should be able to do so.
* Any member with an intention to contribute regardless of their involvement in a certain area of development should be able to influence the development process, access technology, tools and collected data.
* Accelerating the Progress of Humanity - Progress acceleration is the main priority. It can be done via the spread of concepts, tools and ideas to the society.
* We make tools and knowledge to share it with everyone. We are giving the tools to anyone who can use them. Any project having a big audience should increase awareness of other projects discoveries.
* Transparency - Collaborative work can do miracles, so decisions should be made collectively.
* Secrecy between participants is unacceptable.
* Communications should be visible to all interested community members, private communications about crucial questions are undesirable.
* All active community members should be aware about all processes, plans and tasks in the community.
* Inclusion and connectedness - 
* Projects should be open for enthusiasts to participate. 
* All projects in the same area of development should help each other and share tools and resources for the goal of progress acceleration. 
* Attempts to sabotage another project to gain more profits are unacceptable.

## Noveltism

* This community should seek novelty and explore in the maximum ways possible.
* Every project should be experimenting and trying new approaches regardless of financial risks.
* Everything that can be researched should be researched.
* The Research process should have a maximum amount of branches to achieve maximum results in every way possible. 
Metasciences are desirable. Assumption-based research is acceptable to accelerate the process but should be proven in the future. 
Randomized search for novelty and its further exploration is preferable. The more participants involved, the more exploration will be done.

* Cultural Medium - 
For maximum effectiveness, the community is advised to avoid labels that impose methodological standards or limitations. For example, if a project is claimed to be scientific, it obliges it to follow academic standards. A noveltist project can combine the properties of scientific research, art, game, etc.
The creation of an authentic cultural space with its own mythology and memetic technologies contributes to a more effective involvement of participants and resources in the process of research and spread of knowledge to the society.
It is recommended to avoid being dogmatic and provide an interpretation of controversial views of the audience, allowing theories to evolve.
