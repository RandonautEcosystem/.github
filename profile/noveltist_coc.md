# Noveltist Community Code of Conduct

* We believe that technologies and ideas are valuable in themselves and can evolve, and therefore the wider their distribution and the less we try to control it, the faster they will develop.
* For the same reason, we do not recognize methodological labels, such as dividing projects into scientific and art projects, since the construction of an effective cultural medium contributes to the development of technology no less than the competent construction of an experimental methodology.
* Any form of contribution to the development of MMI technologies is welcome.
* Counterproductive actions such as incitement to any form of hatred and devaluation of other people's achievements, as well as actions contrary to the goals of the community are prohibited.
* Commercial use of community technologies is possible by mutual agreement and provided that part of the profits will be used in the interests of the community.
* Exploration before profits - Non-profit models are preferable, since knowledge is the main value. 
* Commercialization of a project is acceptable as a way to obtain the necessary resources but the project should not be fully profit-oriented.
* Research oriented tasks should have higher priority than profit oriented ones.
* Denying research initiatives in favor of saving profits is unacceptable.
* Cooperation of noveltist projects with profit-oriented companies can be carried out on mutually beneficial terms that do not contradict the principles of the noveltist community.
* Technology should not be monopolized or controlled - Open Source model is preferable.
* Attempts to hide technology under NDA's or to restrict its usage will slow down the progress. Any project that can participate in technology development should be able to do so.
* Any member with an intention to contribute regardless of their involvement in a certain area of development should be able to influence the development process, access technology, tools and collected data.
* Accelerating the Progress of Humanity - Progress acceleration is the main priority. It can be done via the spread of concepts, tools and ideas to the society.
* We make tools and knowledge to share it with everyone. We are giving the tools to anyone who can use them. Any project having a big audience should increase awareness of other projects discoveries.
* Transparency - Collaborative work can do miracles, so decisions should be made collectively.
* Secrecy between participants is unacceptable.
* Communications should be visible to all interested community members, private communications about crucial questions are undesirable.
* All active community members should be aware about all processes, plans and tasks in the community.
