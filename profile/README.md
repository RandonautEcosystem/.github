**Welcome to the Randonauts Mind-Matter Interaction Research and Development Community**

This community is dedicated to collaborative research on Mind-Matter Interaction (MMI) technology and related technologies, as well as to the development of Randomness-based methodologies in research.
The target audience for this community are enthusiasts who study the MMI phenomenon and are willing to join forces and share best practices to accelerate progress in this area.

## Featured Repositories

### Random Number Generation

* **[TheRandonauts/quanttp2-rs](https://github.com/TheRandonauts/quanttp2-rs)** - Rust port of the [Quanttp 2](https://github.com/TheRandonauts/quanttp2) entropy server used by Randonautica to serve quantum random numbers

* **[TheRandonauts/quanttp2](https://github.com/TheRandonauts/quanttp2)** - HTTP API that wraps [MeterFeeder](https://github.com/TheRandonauts/MeterFeeder) instead of the [ComScire quantum random number generator API](https://comscire.com/downloads/qwqngdoc/) to support serving entropy from multiple devices. It also adds JSON endpoints. (based on [quanttp](https://github.com/awasisto/quanttp) by [Andika Wasisto](https://www.wasisto.com/))

* **[TheRandonauts/libmeterfeeder-rs](https://github.com/TheRandonauts/libmeterfeeder-rs)** - Rust wrapper around the C++ based [LibMeterFeeder](https://github.com/TheRandonauts/MeterFeeder)

* **[TheRandonauts/MeterFeeder](https://github.com/TheRandonauts/MeterFeeder)** - C++ driver library that allows you to read in random bytes simultaneously from [Core Invention(https://coreinvention.com/)]'s MED devices. (Original [MeterFeeder](https://github.com/vfp2/MeterFeeder) by [FP2](https://github.com/vfp2/))

* **[randogoth/RandonautEntroPy](https://github.com/randogoth/RandonautEntroPy)** - Python tools for interacting with the Randonautica QRNG and Temporal entropy generators

* **[gamblevore/temporal](https://github.com/gamblevore/temporal)** - TemporalLib can generate random numbers, using the time() instruction. (`rtdsc`?)

### Mind-Enabled-Drive Experiments

_Requirement: One of [Core Invention](https://coreinvention.com/)'s MED (Mind-Enabled Drive) quantum random number generator USB [devices](https://github.com/RandonautEcosystem/.github/docs/MED_devices.md)._

* **[danosb/quantum_influence](https://github.com/danosb/quantum_influence)** - An experiment to measure impact of intention on quantum random numbers

* **[luckyjupiter/mmi](https://github.com/luckyjupiter/mmi)** - simple number guessing and other games using random walk bias amplifier and majority voting

* **[AndieNoir/WebPsi](https://github.com/AndieNoir/WebPsi)** - A Python web app to aid psychic abilities experiments.

### Analysis

* **[winternewt/bientropy](https://github.com/winternewt/bientropy)** - "a simple algorithm which computes the approximate entropy of a finite binary string of arbitrary length" using "a weighted average of the Shannon Entropies of the string and all but the last binary derivative of the string." In other words, these metrics can be used to help assess the disorder or randomness of binary or byte strings, particularly those that are too short for other randomness tests.

### Randonaut Forks

* **[openrandonaut/pyrandonaut](https://github.com/openrandonaut/pyrandonaut)** - Python3 module that uses the gaussian kernel density estimate algorithm to find a point with a statistically anomalous density, similar to how an Attractor point is generated by Randonautica

* **[librerandonaut/librerandonaut](https://github.com/librerandonaut/librerandonaut)** - Open source Android app for randonauting. It uses the Gaussian kernel density estimate to find the point with a statistically anomalous density.

### Experiments and Games

* **[bembidiona/bandonautica](https://github.com/bembidiona/bandonautica)** - true random radio using the whole bandcamp site as a database. It is heavily inspired by the Randonauts movement. Escape your Newtonian music bubble!
